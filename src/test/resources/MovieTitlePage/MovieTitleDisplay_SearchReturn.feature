Feature: Movie Title Display Page - Search Return
  This should demonstrate the candidateâ€™s ability to structure Gherkin feature files, and include new steps that describe
  the content of the page. There is no need to provide implementation for these steps.

  Background:
    Given I open the homepage
    And I login with user "username"

  Scenario: Returning the Correct Film from Search

    Given I search for the film "The Imitation Game"
    When I select the listed option for "The Imitation Game"
    Then the page for the selected film must be displayed.
